# UFOs

## Overview of the Project

The purpose of this project was to help Dana build a dynamic webpage to help her showcase information about UFO sightings and allow users to filter the data on the site for multiple criteria in order to obtain the specific information they'd like about the different sightings.

## Results

When using the UFO website, there are two sections a user will need to evaluate to get the information needed. First, they will need to look into the information that is already there before filtering. To see what is already in the data, they will look at the bar at the top of the table to get the headings:

Once they've looked at the headings, they will be able to filter according to the information for which they are looking using the side filter bar:

When they've decided for what information they would like to filter, they can type it in within the category they'd like to limit, using the format shown by the light grey placeholder text. Once that is done, the table will update to show the data that falls within the filtered parameters, as seen in the following example when filtered for the state of Pennsylvania:

They can also filter for multiple parameters at once, making it beneficial for any information they'd like to find within the data set.

## Summary
### Drawback

One drawback of this new design is that a user may not know all the options to input into the filter boxes. For example, if they'd want to filter by the shape, they may see circle, light, and triangle at the top of the table, but not realize there are other options if they'd keep scrolling. In addition, they may not know which dates were available from which they can choose. In the design of the table, it would require an exact input to filter properly.

### Recommendations

1. First, I would recommend expanding the information. The only dates she provided in the data set were 1/1/2010 to 1/13/2010. This does not lend itself to very much information, and may be more useful to users if there was more information available.

2. I would change the design flaw listed above and potentially make a drop-down menu to list the options available or find a way to allow partial inputs to filter the results. This would eliminate the issues with incorrect or incomplete inputs.
